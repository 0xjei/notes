# notes

personal corner for my learnings, thoughts, and ideas.

- [notebooks](notebooks) — structured notes subdivided by topic (e.g., foundational cryptography, zk, ethereum ...).
- [digests](digests) — (un)complete weekly logs of things i’ve studied, explored, built, or just found interesting during the past week.
- [drafts](drafts) — loose drafts for potential blog posts, thoughts, or small projects that might evolve over time.
- [research](research) — early-stage explorations, mini investigations, and r&d-style notes that may grow into something more concrete.

this isn’t a place where i teach things — most of this is unfinished, fragmented, in progress, and __highly__ subject to change.  
my goal is to have one single place that’s publicly visible, democratically commentable, and easy to reference from other platforms or socials — without rewriting stuff from scratch or juggling around multiple platforms or random chats.

it’s just me thinking in public, with my garage door open.  
if something resonates, feel free to drop by, leave a comment, or even open a pr.  
always open to feedback.
